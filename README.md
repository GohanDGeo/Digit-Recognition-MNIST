# A digit recognition app, using a network trained solely on the MNIST dataset

An intro project that uses a simple CNN network, trained on the MNIST dataset, to recognize handwritten digits.
Due to the network being relatively simple and trained only on the MNIST set, there are occurrences where the digits are wrongly recognized.

The app is deployed [here](https://mnist-digit-recognition.streamlit.app/).
